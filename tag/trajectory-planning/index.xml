      <title>Imitation Learning for Urban Driving</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imitation learning holds great promise for addressing the complex task of autonomous urban driving, as experienced human drivers can navigate highly challenging scenarios with ease. While behavior cloning is a widely used imitation learning approach in autonomous driving due to its exemption from risky online interactions, it suffers from the covariate shift issue. To address this limitation, we propose a context-conditioned imitation learning approach that employs a policy to map the context state into the ego vehicle’s future trajectory, rather than relying on the traditional formulation of both ego and context states to predict the ego action. Additionally, to reduce the implicit ego information in the coordinate system, we design an ego-perturbed goal-oriented coordinate system. The origin of this coordinate system is the ego vehicle’s position plus a zero mean Gaussian perturbation, and the x-axis direction points towards its goal position. Our experiments on the real-world large-scale Lyft and nuPlan datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decentralized Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://kguo-cs.github.io/research/multi-agent-trajectory-planning/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As one of the most popular multi-agent path planning approaches, the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA) algorithm assumes that each agent takes half the responsibility for collision avoidance. However, due to the asymmetric situation faced by adjacent agents, they are expected to take different responsibilities for collision avoidance to improve the entire crowd&amp;rsquo;s navigation performance. Thus, in this letter, we propose the variable responsibility optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (VR-ORCA) algorithm, which relaxes the original assumption in ORCA and only requires the responsibilities of a pair of agents sum to one. In particular, the responsibility division between a pair of nearby agents is determined independently for each agent by minimizing a cost function involving their common neighbors. We validate our approach on a variety of simulated benchmarks and the results demonstrate that our novel method is beneficial in reducing the collision probability, travel time and distance of ORCA.&lt;/p&gt;
