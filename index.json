For instance, traffic flow is often trained with MARL to enable intelligent simulations for autonomous driving. However, The existing MARL algorithm only characterizes the relative degree of each agent’s contribution to the team, and cannot express the contribution that the team needs from the agent. Especially in the field of autonomous driving, the team changes over time, and the agent needs to act directly according to the needs of the team. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative method inspired by realistic traffic coordinators called the Traffic Coordinator Network (TraCo). Our approach leverages a combination of cross-attention and counterfactual advantage function, allowing us to extract distinctive characteristics of domain agents and accurately quantify the contribution that a team needs from an agent. Through experiments conducted on four traffic tasks, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, yielding superior performance. Furthermore, our approach enables the emergence of rich and diverse social behaviors among vehicles within the traffic flow.","tags":["Traffic Simulation","Autonomous Driving","Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning"],"title":"TraCo: Learning Virtual Traffic Coordinator for Cooperation with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ke Guo","Wei Jing","Junbo Chen","Jia Pan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"5874ffc3e8b65dbada1b240561d6b51f","permalink":"https://kguo-cs.github.io/publication/autonomous-driving/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/autonomous-driving/","section":"publication","summary":"Imitation learning holds great promise for addressing the complex task of autonomous urban driving, as experienced human drivers can navigate highly challenging scenarios with ease.

Additionally, to reduce the implicit ego information in the coordinate system, we design an ego-perturbed goal-oriented coordinate system.

You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
